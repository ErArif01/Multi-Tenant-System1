## Vertical Scaling(Scaling Up):
 -- Increasing the resources of a single machine, such as adding more CPU,RAM, or storage.
 -- Suitable for applications taht can benefit from a more poweful individual server.

 ## Horizontal Scaling:
  -- Adding more machines or nodes to a system, distributing the load across multiple servers.
  -- Common in cloud environments where you can easily add or remove instances.

  ## Load Balancing :
   -- Distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed.
   -- Improves fault tolerance and enhances the overall performance of a system.

   ## Caching;
    -- Storing frequently accessed data in a cache to reduce the need to fetch it from the original source.
    -- Reduces latency and improves response times.

  ## Content Delivery Network(CDN):
   -- Distributing content geographically across multiple servers to reduce latency and improve load times.
   -- Especially useful for delivering static content like images, videos m and script.

  ## Database Sharding :
   -- Dividing a large database into smaller, more manageable parts called shards, and distributing these shards across multiple servers.
    -- Helps distribute the database workload and improve query performance.

  ## Elasticity:
   -- The ability of a system to automatically scale resources up or down based on demand.
   -- Often associated with cloud computing platforms that offer auto-scaling features.

  ## Serverless Computing;
   -- Running applications without the need to manage underlying infrastructure.
    -- Resources are automatically allocated and scaled based on demand.

  ## Optimizing Code and Algorithms;
   -- Identifying and optimizing bottlenecks in the code or algorithms to improve overall system effiency.
   -- Reducing unnecessary computations and impoving algorithmic complexity.
